# NYC Building Permits

## ORIE4741Project Fall 2019

Group members: Sourabh Chakraborty, Kush Dubey, and Nicolas Morales

Can we predict which kinds of construction permits — residential and commercial — will be approved based on various features about the application’s region?

We’ll use the live [NYC Open Data DOB Permit Issuance](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Housing-Development/DOB-Permit-Issuance/ipu4-2q9a) dataset to gather data about live permit applications, and other NYC Open Data datasets to collect relevant transit, social, and economic features.

The problem is part of the larger question of what areas in a city develop more and less over time. For example, what effect do access to public transit, availability of restaurants and stores, income levels, and crime rates have on development? Which areas have more residential or more commercial construction, and which areas have more upgrades to buildings? The construction permits dataset has information about what kind of construction permits have been approved in different locations, and other datasets have relevant information such as locations of subway stops and crime rates. Based on the types of features found in various NYC Open Data datasets, we expect to find several that are predictors of construction and development.

Identifying zones and neighborhoods that are more likely to have building permits approved can indicate economic and social drivers at play. We intend to identify factors that impact building permit approval, potentially providing recommendations to home and business owners.
